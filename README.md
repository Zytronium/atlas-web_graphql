# GraphQL Backend

This project covers implementing GraphQL using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. 
It implements a project management system similar to Holberton's (Atlas School's
legacy curriculum) with projects and tasks. It covers GraphQL schemas, queries
resolve functions, type relations, connecting to mongoDB, mutation,
and more.

GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that provides the ability to
ask for exactly the data needed; nothing more, nothing less. GraphQL operates
over a single endpoint and allows complex, nested queries in a single call.
It uses a type system to define data structures and provides a strongly typed
contract between frontend and backend. In this project, GraphQL is integrated
via the `express-graphql` middleware, enabling an interactive playground
(GraphiQL) for testing queries and mutations in real time.

### ✅ Tasks checklist:
- [X] ​0. GraphQL Schema (1/1 pt)
- [X] ​1. Root Query (1/? pts)
- [X] ​2. Resolve function and test query in graphiql (1/? pts)
- [X] ​3. GraphQL ID type and Project Type (1/? pts)
- [X] ​4. Type relations (1/? pts)
- [X] ​5. More on root queries: projects and tasks (1/? pts)
- [X] ​6. Connecting to mongoDB Atlas and create mongoose models (1/? pts)
- [ ] ​7. Mutation (0/? pts)
- [ ] ​8. Updating the resolve functions (0/? pts)

###### Since everything except task 0 shows "0/ pts," I'll calculate progress as if everything is 1 point, for a total of 9 pts.

- [X] Readme
- [ ] **Everything Done ✓** (7/9 pts) - 77.78%
